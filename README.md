## Technologies MERN

**MongoDB**  
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that utilizes a document-based data model. This means that data is stored in flexible JSON-like documents, without the need for rigid schemas. MongoDB is particularly well-suited for applications that require scalability and flexibility in data management.

**Express.js**  
Express.js is a backend framework that runs on top of Node.js. It provides a simpler and more efficient way to manage routes, handle HTTP requests, and interact with databases.

**React**  
React is a JavaScript library used to build interactive and reactive user interfaces (UIs). React allows developers to break down the UI into manageable components, making it easier to develop and maintain complex applications.

**Node.js**  
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. Node.js is highly efficient in handling I/O-based requests and is well-suited for building network-based applications, including web applications.
